# AI_Assignment_1
Implementing a simple Search Algorithm in Python
# Introduction:
In this assignment, I got to know how a mapâ€™s detail can be stored in a dictionary or tree data structure (I used dictionary). And, how BFS and DFS algorithm takes up that information to find the route from start to destination.
# Problem Statement:
To check whether BFS algorithm or DFS algorithm gives the least weighed route for the given map, starting point and ending point information.
# Input-Output Requirements:
The program returns the value of the shortest path given by the algorithm, and it specifies the name of the algorithm.
